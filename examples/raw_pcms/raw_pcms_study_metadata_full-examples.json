States were selected using the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strength of administrator qualifications in licensing, credentialing, and Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) criteria, as of June 2018</li>\n<li>Funding to support access and quality</li>\n<li>Stringency of licensing requirements as minimum standards for quality to reflect the regulatory environment</li>\n<li>Geographic diversity</li></ul>\n<p>Once states were selected for the study based on sampling criteria, sampling lists of early care and education (ECE) centers were constructed by pulling information from the Head Start Enterprise System, public websites about community-based centers, and a state Department of Education's list of centers in that state. Researchers conducted varying levels of outreach to over 3,000 centers to ultimately have 132 eligible, participating centers.</p>\n<p>Once centers were deemed eligible, survey respondents were selected, including staff in formal manager roles (center directors or managers) who were responsible for daily operations and the education program in each center and all teaching staff from each center in classrooms serving children from birth through age 5.</p>\n<p>One to three managers per center were selected to receive the center manager survey, depending upon center size.
