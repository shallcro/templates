    "description": "<p><strong>Overview.</strong> The Post-Acute Care Supplement (PACS) files were developed from two administrative data sets that capture assessments at multiple points in post-acute care: the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) Summary File (OASF): 2000-2010, which covers home health care, and the Long-Term Care Annual Summary File (LTCASF): 2000-2010, which covers nursing homes. Annual files were developed for the period 2000 to 2010 that summarize health conditions, functional status, and care patterns into one observation per beneficiary per year.</p>\n<p><strong>Data Access.</strong> These data are not available from ICPSR.  Because the data contain confidential CMS assessment data, researchers will need to secure a data use agreement from CMS.  For researchers who secure a DUA, the files will be distributed to them through the Medicare/Medicaid Research Information Center (MedRIC) (medric@acumenllc.com).</p>",
